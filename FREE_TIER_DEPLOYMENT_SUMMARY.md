# RoomieMatcher AWS Free Tier Deployment Summary

This document provides a comprehensive summary of all the optimizations and configurations made to ensure RoomieMatcher can be deployed within the AWS Free Tier limits.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Elastic Beanstalk Configuration
- **Single Instance Environment**: Configured to use a single instance environment instead of load-balanced
- **No Load Balancer**: Removed load balancer to stay within free tier limits
- **Instance Type**: Using t2.micro instance type (eligible for free tier)
- **Spot Instances**: Enabled spot instances to reduce costs further
- **Basic Health Reporting**: Using basic health reporting instead of enhanced to avoid CloudWatch costs
- **Deployment Policy**: Using "AllAtOnce" deployment policy for single instance environment

### 2. Database Configuration
- **Instance Type**: Using db.t3.micro instance type (eligible for free tier)
- **No Multi-AZ**: Disabled Multi-AZ deployment to stay within free tier
- **No Encryption**: Disabled storage encryption to stay within free tier
- **Limited Storage**: Limited storage to 20GB to stay within free tier
- **Connection Pooling**: Optimized connection pooling in all services

### 3. Docker Optimizations
- **Memory Limits**: Limited container memory in Dockerrun.aws.json
- **JVM Settings**: Optimized JVM memory settings in all Dockerfiles
  ```
  ENV JAVA_OPTS="-Xms96m -Xmx128m -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=100 -XX:+ParallelRefProcEnabled -Xss256k"
  ```

### 4. Application Optimizations
- **Connection Pooling**: Limited maximum pool size to 5 connections
- **Hibernate Optimizations**: Disabled statistics generation and enabled batch processing
- **Thymeleaf Cache**: Enabled template caching to reduce CPU usage
- **Logging**: Reduced logging levels to minimize CloudWatch costs
- **Health Checks**: Optimized health check frequency to reduce API calls

### 5. AWS SES Configuration
- **Instance Profile**: Created IAM role for SES access
- **Email Verification**: Added automatic email verification during deployment
- **Sandbox Mode**: Improved handling of SES sandbox mode limitations

## Deployment Files

### .ebextensions Configuration
Created the following configuration files:
1. **01_environment.config**: Basic environment settings
2. **02_aws_resources.config**: AWS resources and permissions
3. **03_database.config**: Database connection settings
4. **04_container_commands.config**: Setup commands

### Environment Configuration Files
1. **env-config-minimal.json**: Optimized for free tier with minimal settings
2. **env-config-optimized.json**: Updated to remove load balancer and use single instance

### Monitoring
Created **monitor-free-tier.sh** to track AWS free tier usage, including:
- EC2 instance usage
- RDS instance usage
- ECR repository usage
- Elastic Beanstalk environments
- CloudWatch metrics
- SES sending statistics
- CloudWatch Logs usage
- Cost Explorer data

## Deployment Options

### 1. GitHub CI/CD
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use SingleInstance environment type
- Configured to use minimal environment settings
- See **GITHUB_DEPLOYMENT_README.md** for detailed instructions

### 2. Manual Deployment
- Updated manual deployment guide to specify single instance environment
- Removed load balancer configuration from manual deployment steps
- See **MANUAL_BEANSTALK_DEPLOYMENT.md** for detailed instructions

## Cost Monitoring

After deployment, monitor your AWS costs regularly:
1. Set up AWS Budget alerts to notify you if costs approach free tier limits
2. Use the `monitor-free-tier.sh` script to check current usage
3. Consider running the application only when needed during development

## Important Notes

- AWS Free Tier limits change over time. Always check the latest AWS Free Tier documentation.
- The first 12 months of a new AWS account offer the most generous free tier benefits.
- Some services may incur minimal charges even with these optimizations.
- Monitor your usage regularly to avoid unexpected charges.
