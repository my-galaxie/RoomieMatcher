# RoomieMatcher Project Cleanup Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the changes made to fix the project structure and inconsistencies in the RoomieMatcher microservices application. The main goal was to consolidate the codebase by using only the root directory structure and eliminating the duplicate `roomie-matcher-microservices` directory.

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Version Inconsistencies
- Updated all service POM files to use version `1.0.0` to match the root POM
- Updated the root POM with additional properties and dependencies from the duplicate structure

### 2. Fixed DTO Inconsistencies
- Resolved the mismatch between `getText()` and `getBody()` methods in `EmailRequestDTO`
- Standardized DTO implementations across services

### 3. Fixed Exception Handling
- Updated `BaseException` to include the `errorCode` field
- Added missing constructors to ensure compatibility
- Updated `ResourceNotFoundException` to use the errorCode parameter
- Updated `BadRequestException` to use the errorCode parameter

### 4. Removed Lombok Dependencies
- Replaced Lombok annotations with traditional Java code where they were causing compilation issues
- Replaced `@Slf4j` with standard SLF4J logger initialization
- Removed `@RequiredArgsConstructor` and added explicit constructors

### 5. Fixed JWT Authentication
- Updated JWT parsing methods to use the correct API
- Fixed authentication filter implementations

### 6. Fixed Circuit Breaker Configuration
- Removed the unsupported `configureTimeLimiterRegistry` method call
- Fixed logger references

### 7. Created Cleanup Tools
- Added `cleanup-duplicates.sh` script to safely remove the duplicate directory
- Added documentation on project structure in `PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md`

## Remaining Warnings

There are some deprecation warnings in the API Gateway Service related to Spring Security APIs:
- `csrf()`, `formLogin()`, `httpBasic()`, and `authorizeExchange()` methods in `SecurityConfig.java`
- Some deprecated APIs in `RateLimitingFilter.java`

These warnings do not affect functionality but should be addressed in a future update.

## Next Steps

1. Run the cleanup script to remove the duplicate directory:
   ```bash
   chmod +x cleanup-duplicates.sh
   ./cleanup-duplicates.sh
   ```

2. Verify all services start correctly:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. Consider updating the deprecated Spring Security APIs in the API Gateway Service in a future update.
