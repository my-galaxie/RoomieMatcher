# RoomieMatcher - Deployment Preparation

This document summarizes the changes made to prepare the RoomieMatcher application for AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment.

## 1. Project Structure Consolidation

**Issue**: The project had duplicate code in both the root directory and the "roomie-matcher-microservices" subdirectory.

**Solution**: 
- Consolidated the project structure to use only the root directory
- Removed the duplicate "roomie-matcher-microservices" directory
- Ensured all services reference the correct dependencies

## 2. Environment Variable Configuration

**Issue**: Dockerrun.aws.json contained hardcoded values for JWT_SECRET, database passwords, and email credentials.

**Solution**:
- Updated Dockerrun.aws.json to use environment variables for all sensitive information:
  - JWT_SECRET
  - DB_USERNAME and DB_PASSWORD
  - MAIL_HOST, MAIL_PORT, MAIL_USERNAME, and MAIL_PASSWORD
  - AWS_SES_ACCESS_KEY, AWS_SES_SECRET_KEY, AWS_SES_REGION, and AWS_SES_FROM_EMAIL
- Created documentation on how to set up these environment variables securely

## 3. CI/CD Pipeline Configuration

**Issue**: The GitHub Actions workflow needed to be updated to include environment variables for the deployment.

**Solution**:
- Updated .github/workflows/deploy-to-aws.yml to include all necessary environment variables
- Added proper substitution of these variables in Dockerrun.aws.json during deployment
- Ensured AWS region parameter is correctly configured

## 4. Deployment Documentation

**Issue**: Needed comprehensive documentation for AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment.

**Solution**:
- Created DEPLOYMENT_SECRETS.md with instructions on setting up GitHub secrets
- Updated README.md with AWS Elastic Beanstalk deployment instructions
- Created deploy-to-beanstalk.sh script for manual deployment
- Linked to existing detailed deployment guides

## 5. Security Enhancements

**Issue**: Sensitive information was hardcoded in configuration files.

**Solution**:
- Externalized all sensitive information as environment variables
- Added security considerations section to README.md
- Documented best practices for handling credentials and secrets

## Deployment Instructions

1. Set up the required GitHub secrets as described in [DEPLOYMENT_SECRETS.md](DEPLOYMENT_SECRETS.md)
2. Push the changes to the main branch to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow
3. Monitor the deployment in the AWS Elastic Beanstalk console
4. Verify that the application is functioning correctly in the AWS environment

For manual deployment, use the provided script:
```bash
./deploy-to-beanstalk.sh --bucket your-s3-bucket-name --region your-aws-region
