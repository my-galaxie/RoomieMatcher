# RoomieMatcher Microservices

RoomieMatcher is a platform that helps users find compatible roommates based on preferences like budget, location, cleanliness, noise tolerance, and more.

This project is a microservices implementation of the RoomieMatcher application, transformed from a monolithic Spring Boot application.

## Project Structure Cleanup

The project structure has been consolidated to use only the root directory structure, eliminating the duplicate `roomie-matcher-microservices` directory. This cleanup ensures:

- Single source of truth for all code
- Consistent dependency management
- Simplified build process
- Elimination of code duplication

To complete the cleanup, run the provided script:
```bash
chmod +x cleanup-duplicates.sh
./cleanup-duplicates.sh -y
```

## Architecture

The application is divided into the following microservices:

1. **Auth Service**: Handles user registration, authentication, and account verification
2. **Profile Service**: Manages tenant profiles and preferences
3. **Match Service**: Implements the roommate matching algorithm
4. **Notification Service**: Sends email notifications
5. **API Gateway**: Routes requests to appropriate services

## Technology Stack

- **Java 17**: Programming language
- **Spring Boot 3.2.0**: Application framework
- **Spring Cloud**: Microservices ecosystem
- **Spring Security**: Authentication and authorization
- **PostgreSQL**: Database
- **Flyway**: Database migrations

#### Option 1: Using GitHub Actions

1. Set up the required GitHub secrets as described in [DEPLOYMENT_SECRETS.md](DEPLOYMENT_SECRETS.md)
2. Push your changes to the main branch
3. GitHub Actions will automatically deploy to AWS Elastic Beanstalk

#### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. Use the provided deployment script:
   ```bash

- [AWS Beanstalk Deployment Guide](aws-beanstalk-deployment-guide.md): Comprehensive guide with step-by-step instructions
- [AWS Beanstalk Quick Start](aws-beanstalk-quickstart.md): Quick start guide for rapid deployment
- [AWS Beanstalk Cost Optimization](aws-beanstalk-cost-optimization.md): Tips for optimizing costs

## Security Considerations

- All sensitive information (JWT secrets, database credentials, AWS keys) should be stored as environment variables or AWS secrets
- Do not commit any sensitive information to the repository
- Use IAM roles with least privilege principle
- Enable HTTPS for all communications

## üöÄ RoomieMatcher ‚Äì Intelligent Roommate Matching System

RoomieMatcher is a web application that helps users find compatible roommates based on their preferences and lifestyle choices. The application uses an intelligent matching algorithm to calculate compatibility scores between potential roommates.

- **User Authentication**: Secure registration and login system
- **Preference Setting**: Users can set their preferences for budget, location, cleanliness, noise tolerance, smoking, and pets
- **Smart Matching Algorithm**: Smart algorithm that calculates compatibility scores based on user preferences
- **Match Visualization**: Clear display of potential roommates with compatibility scores
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
- **Email Verification**: OTP-based email verification
- **Profile Management**: Manage user profile and preferences
- **Search and Filter**: Search and filter potential roommates
- **Gender-Based Filtering**: Filter roommates based on gender
- REST API endpoints
- Styled web interface using Thymeleaf + Bootstrap
- PostgreSQL database integration
- Java OOP concepts: Inheritance, Interfaces, Threads implemented

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Java with Spring Boot
- **Frontend**: Thymeleaf templates with Bootstrap 5
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Security**: Spring Security with BCrypt password encoding
- **ORM**: Hibernate/JPA
  
## üìã Prerequisites

- Java 17 or higher
- PostgreSQL 12 or higher
- Maven (or use the included Maven wrapper)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Database Setup

1. Create a PostgreSQL database named `roomiematcher_db`:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE roomiematcher_db;
   ```

2. Update the `application.properties` file with your database credentials:
   ```properties
   spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/roomiematcher_db
   spring.datasource.username=postgres
   spring.datasource.password=12345
   ```

### Running the Application

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/roomiematcher.git
   cd roomiematcher
   ```

2. Run the application using Maven:
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

3. Access the application in your browser:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

### Data Persistence

The application is configured to maintain user data and preferences between restarts. The following settings in `application.properties` ensure data persistence:

```
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
spring.sql.init.mode=never
```

### Initializing Sample Data

To initialize the database with sample data (only needed once):

1. Set `app.init-data=true` in `application.properties`
2. Run the application
3. After the data is initialized, set `app.init-data=false` to prevent re-initialization

Alternatively, you can run the `init-data.sql` script directly in your PostgreSQL database:

```
psql -U postgres -d roomiematcher_db -f src/main/resources/init-data.sql
```

## üßÆ Matching Algorithm

The matching algorithm calculates compatibility scores based on several factors:

- **Budget Compatibility**: Higher score for similar budget ranges
- **Location Preference**: Maximum points if both users prefer the same location
- **Lifestyle Compatibility**:
  - Cleanliness level (1-5 scale)
  - Noise tolerance (1-5 scale)
  - Smoking preference (yes/no)
  - Pet preference (yes/no)

The algorithm assigns weights to each factor and calculates a final score out of 100.

## üì± Application Flow

1. **Registration**: New users create an account
2. **Preferences**: Users set their roommate preferences
3. **Matching**: The system calculates compatibility scores with other users
4. **Results**: Users can view and contact potential roommates

## üîí Security

- Passwords are securely hashed using BCrypt
- Form validation to prevent common security issues
- CSRF protection enabled

## üîÑ Future Enhancements

- Chat functionality between matched users
- Profile pictures and more detailed user profiles
- Advanced filtering options
- Mobile app version
- Integration with map services for location-based matching

## üìú License

This project is created for learning purposes only.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the Application
### Option 1: With Maven Wrapper
```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run
```
### Option 2: In VS Code / IntelliJ
Right-click on `RoomieMatcherApplication.java` and select **Run**.

## üåê Access the Web App
Visit:
```
http://localhost:8080/
```

### REST API Test:
```
http://localhost:8080/api/roommates/match/1/2
```

---

##  Sample Data
See `src/main/resources/data.sql` for preloaded users.
You can modify this to add more tenants.

---

## Java OOP Concepts Demonstrated
- **Inheritance**: `Tenant` inherits from `User`
- **Interfaces**: `MatchingAlgorithm` is implemented by `BasicMatching`
- **Thread**: Background data cleaning simulated in `RoommateService`
